  The Holy Bible is the sacred scripture of the Christian faith. It is a collection of ancient texts written by multiple authors over a span of centuries. 
  
  The Bible is divided into two main sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament contains the sacred writings of the Jewish faith, while the New Testament contains the teachings of Jesus Christ and the early Christian church. 
  
  The Bible is considered by Christians to be the inspired word of God and the ultimate authority on matters of faith and practice.

  The Bible is a rich and complex text that has been interpreted and studied by scholars and theologians for centuries. It contains a wide variety of literary genres, including poetry, history, prophecy, and wisdom literature.

  It is highly reccomended that you explore biblical archeology, history, and theology to gain a deeper understanding of the Bible and its significance. You will find that the Bible is used as an accurate historical record. 
  
  The Writer Company is proud to present the Holy Bible (KJV) in a digital format for your reading. Additionally, we have compiled this KJV Bible into a modern JSON format for easy access and manipulation. You can find it on our Github repository. Enjoy your reading!

  Please make good use of the work that I, Rennie Maharaj, have put into this project. I have spent countless hours to bring this to you. I hope you enjoy it. God bless you and build your bricks upon the rock of Jesus Christ. Amen.
